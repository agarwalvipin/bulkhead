# Phase 2: Design

**Goal:** Propose technical solutions and analyze refactoring impact.

## Protocol
1.  **Architectural Review**:
    - Propose 2 options (if applicable).
    - Analyze component impact.
2.  **Generate Artifacts (Double-Write)**:
    - `architecture/02-design.md`: Diagrams, pros/cons.
    - `architecture/02-design.json`: Structured impact analysis.
    - **Schema:** `schemas/design-spec.schema.json`.
